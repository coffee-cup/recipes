# Recipes

This is a simple online recipe manager built with [React](https://reactjs.org/),
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), and
[Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/).

I became frusturated with the currrent online recipe systems so decided to build my own. This is intended to be
- simple
- minimal
- straight to the point

## Development

``` shell
yarn
yarn start
```
